# Matrix Rotation

# problem statement

Given a 2D matrix, a, of dimension MxN (M is number of rows and N is number of columns)
and a positive integer R. You have to rotate the matrix R times counter-clockwise.

The constraint is that the minimum of M and N is always even.

# example

Given a matrix with size 4x4, and rotate it 1 time:

1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16

The rotated matrix becomes:

2 3 4 8
1 7 11 12
5 6 10 16
9 13 14 15

Noted that the rotated matrix has the same size as the original matrix
